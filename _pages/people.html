Dan is currently a Scientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, where he worked on development and testing of high-density extracellular electrophysiology methods, in service of studying the population statistics and circuit interactions that underlie visual representation in the mouse early visual system. Prior to that, he received a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Pennsylvania, in the lab of Diego Contreras. Even longer ago than that he began his journey into experimental neuroscience, and the statistics of visual representations, working with Rowland Taylor (then at OHSU) as an undergraduate at Reed College.
