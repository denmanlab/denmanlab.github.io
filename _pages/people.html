<h4>We're Hiring</h4>
<a href="mailto:daniel.denman@cuanschutz.edu">Contact us! </a> 
<p>The Denman Lab at the University of Colorado School of Medicine is seeking to hire one or more  post-doctoral researchers interested in using cutting edge neurophysiology techniques to study the neural coding of information within and across multiple brain areas. Funded projects include both high-density electrophysiology and neuromodulation with intracranial electrical stimulation. </p>
<br>
<p>The Denman Lab is located on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora Colorado and the Denver Metropolitan area and offers proximity the Front Range and easy access to the Rockies. The Denman lab is committed to growing diversity in science and creating an inclusive and supportive working environment. </p>

    PI. Dan was previously a Scientist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, where he worked on development and testing of high-density extracellular electrophysiology methods, in service of studying the population statistics and circuit interactions that underlie visual representation in the mouse early visual system. Prior to that, he received a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from the University of Pennsylvania, in the lab of Diego Contreras. Even longer ago than that he began his journey into experimental neuroscience, and the statistics of visual representations, working with Rowland Taylor (then at OHSU) as an undergraduate at Reed College.
